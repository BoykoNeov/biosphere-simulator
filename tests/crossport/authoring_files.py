"""The file-level parse-parity harness for the Phase-9 Step-4b Rust `authoring` port.

Unlike Step 4a (rate *strings* → committed vector files), the shared cross-port
artifact here is the scenario **`.yaml` file itself** — both the Python interpreter
(`src/authoring`) and the Rust interpreter (`rust/crates/authoring`) read the *same*
committed file. So there is no generated vector file; the gates are:

* **byte-identity** — the Rust interpreter's run of an anchor reproduces the frozen
  golden byte-for-byte (crew / template@1.0 → `crew_state.json`), and every anchor's
  Rust run == the Python interpreter's run of the same file (Rust-parse ≡ Python-parse
  ≡ same trajectory). Those live in `test_crossport.py`.
* **structural graph-dump parity** — this module's :func:`render_graph_dump` renders an
  interpreted `BuiltScenario` to a canonical text; the Rust `dump_graph` example renders
  the *same* text from its interpreter, and `test_crossport.py` diffs them. This catches
  graph facts a final-state snapshot is blind to (flow priorities, present-but-inert
  flows, the bit-exact boundary-eval of an initial amount / forcing constant).

**The dump format is a parity contract** — keep it byte-identical to the Rust
`authoring::graph_dump::render_graph_dump` (the `sexpr`/`gen_engine_vectors` discipline,
one level up to whole files). Every float goes through `float.hex()` (the Rust side
uses the same hex-float codec), so boundary-eval parity is proven bit-exact.

from authoring.interpreter import BuiltScenario, load_scenario

# The anchor scenarios (relative to tests/authoring/scenarios) + the template overrides
# each is exercised with. Kept here so `test_crossport.py` and any Rust-side driver
# iterate the same set. `overrides` is the CLI form `param=value` the Rust example uses.
#
# (scenario_file, overrides_dict, byte_identical_golden_or_None, float_tier)
#
# `float_tier` classifies the RUN comparison, exactly as `tiers.json` does for the 20
# frozen goldens, and by the same rule: **classify by the ops the simulator EXECUTES**,
# never by observed equality on one machine.
#
#   * Tier 1 — the reachable per-step graph is transcendental-free (`+ - *`), so the run
#     is bit-exact across ports and `test_rust_authoring_run_matches_python` compares it
#     with `==`.
#   * Tier 2 — the graph has a transcendental, so it is EXCLUDED from that bit-exact
#     comparison. Tier 1 added the first such anchor (`thermal_node.yaml`:
#     `thermal.radiator_reject` evaluates `T**4`, a grep-confirmed transcendental site
#     in tiers.json, ported as `powf(4.0)`).
#
# **Why Tier-2 is excluded rather than band-compared** — a trap worth naming: the
# fresh-vs-fresh `rust_final == python_final` check would actually PASS for thermal_node
# on any single machine, because Rust and CPython there call the same libm. The measured
# Tier-2 bands exist for golden(UCRT)-vs-fresh(glibc) comparisons — a genuinely
# cross-libm measurement. Asserting that same-libm pass would silently label a `powf`
# flow Tier-1 and break the moment the CI matrix changed. And no NEW band is minted
# for it: a measured band is a frozen tolerance, and freezing one for a runtime-only
# authored artifact cuts against "authored != validated".
#
# What covers a Tier-2 anchor instead, in full: the cross-port GRAPH DUMP (bit-exact for
# it — the dump renders authored literals via float.hex() and never calls the radiator's
# evaluate(), so the transcendental cannot reach it), a Rust unit test that the authored
# RadiatorReject is wired to `params::thermal()` (the one sliver the dump cannot see,
# since params are not rendered), and the Python-side run gate in
# tests/test_authoring_frozen_flows.py. Its runtime ARITHMETIC parity is already frozen
# by thermal_state.json's measured band — re-proving it here would add nothing.
