"""The file-level parse-parity harness for the Phase-9 Step-4b Rust `authoring` port.

Unlike Step 4a (rate *strings* → committed vector files), the shared cross-port
artifact here is the scenario **`.yaml` file itself** — both the Python interpreter
(`src/authoring`) and the Rust interpreter (`rust/crates/authoring`) read the *same*
committed file. So there is no generated vector file; the gates are:

* **byte-identity** — the Rust interpreter's run of an anchor reproduces the frozen
  golden byte-for-byte (crew / template@1.0 → `crew_state.json`), and every anchor's
  Rust run == the Python interpreter's run of the same file (Rust-parse ≡ Python-parse
  ≡ same trajectory). Those live in `test_crossport.py`.
* **structural graph-dump parity** — this module's :func:`render_graph_dump` renders an
  interpreted `BuiltScenario` to a canonical text; the Rust `dump_graph` example renders
  the *same* text from its interpreter, and `test_crossport.py` diffs them. This catches
  graph facts a final-state snapshot is blind to (flow priorities, present-but-inert
  flows, the bit-exact boundary-eval of an initial amount / forcing constant).

**The dump format is a parity contract** — keep it byte-identical to the Rust
`authoring::graph_dump::render_graph_dump` (the `sexpr`/`gen_engine_vectors` discipline,
one level up to whole files). Every float goes through `float.hex()` (the Rust side
uses the same hex-float codec), so boundary-eval parity is proven bit-exact.

from authoring.interpreter import BuiltScenario, load_scenario

# The anchor scenarios (relative to tests/authoring/scenarios) + the template overrides
# each is exercised with. Kept here so `test_crossport.py` and any Rust-side driver
# iterate the same set. `overrides` is the CLI form `param=value` the Rust example uses.
#
# (scenario_file, overrides_dict, byte_identical_golden_or_None, float_tier)
#
# `float_tier` classifies the RUN comparison, exactly as `tiers.json` does for the 20
# frozen goldens, and by the same rule: **classify by the ops the simulator EXECUTES**,
# never by observed equality on one machine.
#
#   * Tier 1 — the reachable per-step graph is transcendental-free (`+ - *`), so the run
#     is bit-exact across ports and `test_rust_authoring_run_matches_python` compares it
#     with `==`.
#   * Tier 2 — the graph has a transcendental, so it is EXCLUDED from that bit-exact
#     comparison. Tier 1 added the first such anchor (`thermal_node.yaml`:
#     `thermal.radiator_reject` evaluates `T**4`, a grep-confirmed transcendental site
#     in tiers.json, ported as `powf(4.0)`).
#
# **Why Tier-2 is excluded rather than band-compared** — a trap worth naming: the
# fresh-vs-fresh `rust_final == python_final` check would actually PASS for thermal_node
# on any single machine, because Rust and CPython there call the same libm. The measured
# Tier-2 bands exist for golden(UCRT)-vs-fresh(glibc) comparisons — a genuinely
# cross-libm measurement. Asserting that same-libm pass would silently label a `powf`
# flow Tier-1 and break the moment the CI matrix changed. And no NEW band is minted
# for it: a measured band is a frozen tolerance, and freezing one for a runtime-only
# authored artifact cuts against "authored != validated".
#
# What covers a Tier-2 anchor instead, in full: the cross-port GRAPH DUMP (bit-exact for
# it — the dump renders authored literals via float.hex() and never calls the radiator's
# evaluate(), so the transcendental cannot reach it), a Rust unit test that the authored
# RadiatorReject is wired to `params::thermal()` (the one sliver the dump cannot see,
# since params are not rendered), and the Python-side run gate in
# tests/test_authoring_frozen_flows.py. Its runtime ARITHMETIC parity is already frozen
# by thermal_state.json's measured band — re-proving it here would add nothing.

    # transcendental-free ⇒ **Tier 1**, which is the whole point of preferring it to the
    # obvious candidate: `eclss_thermal_habitat.yaml` is Tier-2 (`T**4`), so it could
    # only ever be graph-dump-covered, leaving the multi-rate DRIVER uncompared across
    # ports. Here both gates bite, so `run_multirate` (Rust) and `_run_multirate`
    # (Python) are finally compared to *each other* — until this row, each port only
    # pinned its own. `eclss.cabin_h2o` is shared across the rate-class boundary, so the
    # Strang operators do not commute and a mis-lowered partition is a ~29 % trajectory
    # divergence, not a rendering nit (measured:
    # tests/test_authoring_multirate_crossport_anchor.py). No golden — no frozen
    # scenario runs ECLSS multi-rate, so there is nothing to be byte-identical to.

    # --- The compose gap: the multi-rate partition x `{bundle, prefix}` namespacing ---
    # Step 6b named this and did not fix it: "the `rate_class`-survives-prefixing claim
    # in `compose.rs` remains UNANCHORED — this file declares no `includes`." The row
    # above still declares none; this one is the only anchor where a rate class and a
    # prefix meet. The same battery domain from two bundles differing by ONE key, so a
    # bundle-declared slow flow must reach the built partition under its NAMESPACED id
    # (`bat_slow.power.self_discharge`) and its fast twin must not.
    #
    # THE GRAPH DUMP IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF HERE, and that is the mirror image of the
    # row above. Step 6b needed Tier 1 because a mis-DRIVEN partition (a split drift)
    # changes no graph fact, so the dump structurally cannot see it. This claim is the
    # other kind: a dropped/hardcoded `rate_class` is a mis-BUILT partition, which the
    # dump renders directly — it reads the class off `slow_registry` membership, never
    # off the authored key. The run comparison rides along because the file is
    # transcendental-free (`k*battery`) => Tier 1, not because it is the stronger gate.
    #
    # The run half is not decorative either, but it is honestly WEAK, and the number is
    # recorded rather than rounded up to Step 6b's headline: the inline
    # `power.trickle_load`
    # (fast) drains the SLOW instance's battery, so the two rate classes share a stock,
    # Strang does not commute, and dropping the partition moves that stock by ~1.1 J on
    # ~9.88e6 J (~1.1e-7 relative) — nonzero, ~2^-23, robustly above any rounding, and
    # bit-exactly compared. It is nothing like the 29 % of `eclss_multirate_cabin`,
    # because `k*dt` is 3.6e-5 here rather than 0.45. Without that inline flow the two
    # prefixed instances would be disjoint, the operators would commute EXACTLY, and the
    # run half would pass on a port that had dropped `rate_class` altogether — the "a
    # partition with no shared stock is decorative" lesson, applied rather than
    # repeated.
