"""Flows: structured, atomic, stoichiometric transfers (decisions #1/#2).

A ``Flow`` exposes only ``evaluate`` — legs exist **only after** evaluation
against a snapshot (the key step-3 correction). So balance and referential
integrity are *evaluation-time* properties, not registration-time:

  * **Balance** is a property of an evaluated ``FlowResult``: per conserved
    ``Quantity``, the legs sum to ~0 (every mole withdrawn from one carbon stock
    lands in another carbon stock, boundary reservoirs included). Resolving a
    leg's quantity needs a stock lookup, so the check is a pure helper over
    ``(result, stocks)`` — used here and **reused by the step-8 every-step
    conservation gate** (hence the shared ``ASSERTED_QUANTITIES`` / ``BALANCE_*``
    contract living in ``simcore.quantities``).
  * **Referential integrity** (every produced ``Leg.stock`` is a real stock) is
    *not* checked here — it is an assertion in the apply path (step 5/6), which
    runs before the conservation gate. A typo'd stock id surfaces as a
    ``KeyError`` at the first step, by design.

``ENERGY`` is exempt from the asserted balance (decision #8: energy closure is
Phase 5/6). ``per_quantity_residual`` still reports it (the diagnostic);
``assert_flow_balanced`` iterates only ``ASSERTED_QUANTITIES``.

Pure stdlib only.
