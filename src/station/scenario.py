"""The Station scenario — the coupled Power → Thermal heat-closure run (P6.1).

The station analogue of ``domains.power.scenario`` / ``domains.thermal.scenario``, one
level up: a station scenario is **not** a new set of coefficients — it *references* the
already-validated sibling scenarios and adds only the cross-domain wiring choices. For
Step 1 the only sibling with tunable run data is Power (the diurnal microgrid); Thermal
contributes its ``radiator.yaml`` params (loaded, not scenario data) and no run data of
its own — the radiator is the restoring force, so it needs no forcing schedule.

**What Step 1 couples.** The standalone Power domain dumped every degraded joule into a
terminal ``boundary.waste_heat`` sink (a deliberate seam). The standalone Thermal domain
received a *forced* ``heat_load`` stand-in for "Power's dissipation" into its node. Step
1 removes both stand-ins and lets them meet at one shared stock: Power's dissipation
legs now deposit into ``thermal.node`` directly, and the Stefan-Boltzmann radiator
rejects that **real** load to deep space. The seam is pure sink re-wiring
(``system.build_station`` passes ``thermal.node``'s id where the Power flows took
``waste_heat``) — zero domain change, zero core change (finding #1).

**The node's initial heat is DERIVED from Power's actual output, not hand-set.** Because
Power runs daily-balanced (``load_fraction = 1`` ⇒ SOC returns to ``battery0`` every
day), in steady state *all* supplied solar energy ends up as heat in the node
(charge-conversion loss ``(1−η_c)·S`` + the 100 %-dissipative load ``η_c·S`` = ``S`` per
day). The mean dissipated power sets an emergent equilibrium node temperature;
``build_station`` starts the node at the corresponding ``Q_eq``
(``system.equilibrium_node_heat``), so the run begins near the attractor the *actual*
dissipation implies. That the equilibrium is set by dissipation independent of the
initial condition is proved **non-circularly** by the two-start convergence test (two
``node0`` values under identical Power forcing converge to one band — the radiator alone
governs the difference), not by starting there.

**Time unit / step come from the Power scenario** (``dt = 3600 s``, ``steps_per_day =
24``) — Thermal standalone used the same ``dt``, so there is no rate mismatch to
reconcile (the increment-form flows are dt-linear anyway, #multi-rate-safe). The horizon
is a day count, like Power's ``BOUNDED_SOC_DAYS``.

Pure stdlib only (a frozen dataclass wrapping the Power scenario).

    """Step-2 gas-loop run data: the crew↔ECLSS cabin-air coupling (P6.2).

    A *fresh* scenario (not a reference to a sibling's, unlike ``StationScenario``
    wrapping ``PowerScenario``): the coupled cabin merges two siblings whose standalone
    scenarios made **incompatible** choices — Crew ran ``dt = 3600 s`` (monotone store
    depletion, dt-agnostic forced draws), ECLSS ran ``dt = 60 s`` (needed for
    ``k_scrub·dt < 1`` structural positivity). The coupled step must be **one** ``dt``,
    and ECLSS's constraint is the binding one, so the gas loop adopts ``dt = 60 s``. The
    forced crew intake rates are re-sized here (not reused from either standalone
    scenario) so the emergent cabin steady states are positive and well-fed under the
    shared ECLSS control-loop params (``eclss.yaml``) + crew split fractions
    (``crew.yaml``).

    **What the coupling changes vs the two standalones.** Standalone ECLSS drove the
    cabin with a *forced* ``CrewMetabolism`` stand-in (independent O₂/CO₂/H₂O rates, RQ
    ≈ 0.75); standalone Crew drew O₂ from a separate ``crew.o2_store`` into a decoupled
    sink and exhaled *pure-carbon* CO₂. Coupled, the real crew ``CrewRespiration``
    (``station.flows``) breathes **cabin** O₂ and exhales into the **cabin** CO₂ pool at
    **RQ = 1** (the PQ = 1 template), so O₂ consumption = CO₂ production is no longer a
    free rate — it is ``respired_carbon_fraction · food_intake``. WATER stays on the
    separate crew ``WaterBalance → cabin_h2o`` path (metabolic water ignored; food
    carries no WATER composition — the phase-6 scope boundary).

    **The cabin reaches a steady state; the stores run down (the hybrid, honestly).**
    The three ECLSS control loops (scrubber / condenser / O₂ makeup) are the restoring
    forces, so each cabin species relaxes to an emergent steady state
    (``cabin.cabin_steady_state``); but ``crew.food_store`` / ``crew.water_store`` are
    still *forced* draws with no resupply, so they deplete monotonically (open-loop,
    like standalone Crew). Step 2 closes the gas loop's **atom coupling** (OXYGEN closes
    across the augmented crew↔cabin loop), **not** the provisioning — regenerating the
    stores is Steps 4 (water) / 6 (food). Sizing keeps every store well-fed over the
    horizon (``rationed == 0``).

    Fields: the initial cabin inventories (a clean cabin at the O₂ setpoint, so the crew
    draw pulls O₂ down and CO₂/H₂O rise from 0 — the ECLSS monotone-relaxation

    References the Step-3 :class:`GreenhouseScenario` it is built on (the
    ``StationScenario``-wrapping-``PowerScenario`` rhythm) and adds the single Step-6
    knob: the biosphere phenology at ``t = 0``. The ``Harvest`` flow
    (:class:`station.flows.Harvest`) drains the biosphere's ``storage_c`` (grain) into
    the crew ``food_store`` in the cabin / fast registry, making the crew's finite food
    **regenerative** — the CARBON twin of Step 4's ``WaterRecovery``. The harvest rate
    is a loaded param (``harvest.yaml``), not scenario data.

    **The reproductive plant (the "it bit" precondition).** ``storage_c`` fills only
    after anthesis (``FO > 0`` needs ``DVS > 1``), and a fresh seedling sits at
    ``DVS < 1`` with ``storage_c0 = 0`` — so the default greenhouse plant would give a
    zero harvest source. :attr:`thermal_time0` starts the biosphere's ``thermal_time``
    accumulator **past** anthesis (``tsum_anthesis = 1100`` °C·day), so ``DVS > 1`` and
    grain is actively *filling* while harvest drains it (a regenerative source, not a
    static reservoir). This is a **station** field injected at :class:`State`
    construction in :func:`station.harvest.build_harvest` — the station owns the
    greenhouse ``State``'s aux dict, so it needs no change to ``SeasonScenario`` (adding
    a ``thermal_time0`` field there would be a domain change, forbidden by the Phase-6
    exit criterion).

    Runs under the two-rate :func:`station.driver.run_master_day` (the greenhouse
    rhythm: biosphere slow once/day, cabin fast ×``steps_per_day``), so all
    timing/horizon fields come from the embedded greenhouse scenario.
