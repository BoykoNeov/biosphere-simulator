"""The declarative scenario-file schema (pydantic, the config boundary).

Validates the shape of an authored scenario file into typed specs the interpreter
lowers to frozen engine objects. Step 0 = the **composition subset**: stocks (ICs),
flows (existing frozen types + wiring + a param-set reference), constant forcings,
and the run config (integrator/dt/steps). Every model is ``extra="forbid"`` — a
typo'd key is a schema error, not a silent drop (the ``config`` loader discipline).

**The pyyaml numeric hazard is handled here.** ``yaml.safe_load`` uses the YAML-1.1
float resolver, under which ``1e-3`` (no decimal point) parses as a *string*, not a
float. Every float field below is a pydantic ``float`` (string→float coercion is a
backstop), and scenario files are written with an explicit decimal point
(``1.0e-3``); the interpreter's anchor test additionally asserts the loaded ICs and
forcings equal the frozen reference values, so a silent string-parse fails loudly.
