"""The biosphere subsystem hierarchy (Phase-3 P3.1) — domain-side, ``simcore``-free.

Phase 3 splits the monolithic ``biosphere`` domain into four **leaf compartments** —
``atmosphere`` / ``soil`` / ``plants`` / ``water`` — under a ``biosphere`` root::

    biosphere
      |- biosphere.atmosphere
      |- biosphere.soil
      |- biosphere.plants
      `- biosphere.water

A compartment is **a ``DomainId`` namespace plus its stock membership and a parent**
— *not* a rich class and *never* a sub-solver (the integrator stays global; one clock,
one ledger, one conservation gate — see ``docs/plans/phase-3-modular-biosphere.md``
P3.1). The split moves only each stock's ``Stock.domain`` **label** (no stock/flow id
is renamed), so every float reduction — which keys on stock id / quantity name, never
``domain`` — is byte-stable and the goldens regenerate with **domain-label-only diffs
and bit-identical amounts** (the proof the restructure was behavior-preserving).

**Why this lives outside ``simcore`` (the resolved P3.1 build decision — Option B).**
The parent map and the hierarchy view that reads it are **pure reporting metadata**:
the integrator, conservation gate, arbitration, and resolver never touch them. Holding
them domain-side (rather than as a ``Registry(parents=...)`` field) keeps ``simcore``
literally untouched and is the reversible branch — adding the map to the registry later,
*if* an in-core consumer ever appears, is additive; removing it from a frozen surface
would be breaking. **Coupling rule:** the boundary-ledger helper that consumes this map
must also live outside ``simcore`` (it does — below); never split the map out but its
consumer in. Acceptance: ``git diff src/simcore/`` shows zero new symbols.

The leaf-``DomainId`` constants are the single source of truth the scenario
(``season.py``) reads when it assigns each stock to its compartment. This module also
hosts the **per-compartment boundary ledger** — the diagnostic that consumes the
hierarchy (the resolved coupling rule: the map *and* its consumer stay outside
``simcore``).

Pure stdlib only (a plain mapping, a frozenset rollup, and a per-step delta fold).

# from the same legs + state deltas, surfaced in reports / asserted in tests, never
# aborting a step. Its honest value is two things: (1) per-boundary **flux reporting**
# — "net carbon plants→atmosphere this step", the payoff that makes a 4-compartment
# system debuggable; (2) **local apply-integrity** — the identity below trips on a
# *balanced-but-misapplied* delta (compensating misapplications that net to zero
# globally). It does NOT catch a flow wired into the wrong compartment — that is a
# separate *behavioral* assertion (per cross-compartment flow, Step 3+), because both
# sides of the identity move together under a mislabel.

      legs of fully-internal flows are excluded (they cancel, contributing nothing).
      These are **gross**: a multi-leg crossing flow that also redistributes *within*
      the compartment (e.g. ``Allocation`` shuffling plant organs) inflates both sides
      equally. The reporting payoff ("net carbon plants→atmosphere") is the **net**
      ``crossing_in − crossing_out``; the gross pair is the audit detail behind it.
    - ``stored_delta`` — folded ``Σ (after − before)`` over the compartment's stocks.
    - ``residual`` — ``(crossing_in − crossing_out) − stored_delta``, the
      **apply-integrity** check: ``net crossing == ΔStored`` because internal flows
      cancel, so a nonzero residual means a stock moved by an amount no leg accounts
      for. It is *not* a wiring check (a mislabel moves both sides together).

      **Holds only on a "clean" step** — ``flow_results`` are the **post-arbitration**
      legs (a backstop-scaled flow's *applied* delta is its scaled leg, not the raw
      ``evaluate()`` result) **and** no **non-flow** state change occurred. Extinction
      routing (POPULATION → loss-sink, #6) is a *balanced non-flow* change that
      ``after − before`` includes but **no leg** does, so an extinction step
      legitimately yields ``residual ≠ 0`` for that stock's compartment. Such steps are
      **expected exceptions to handle when this is wired live (Step 5)** — not bugs.
      The Phase-1/2 goldens are ``rationed == 0`` + extinction-free, so neither arises.
