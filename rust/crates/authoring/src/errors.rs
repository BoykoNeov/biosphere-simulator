//! does not match the flow type's fields, an unbalanced authored stoichiometry, a
//! reference to an undeclared param) surfaces as one [`AuthoringError`]. It carries a
//! human message; **the message text is NOT a parse-parity target** (Tier-0 is
//! accept→same-graph, reject→both-error — the Step-4a discipline, one level up to
//! files). Engine-side failures (a mis-wire that only surfaces at the every-step
//! conservation gate) stay [`simcore::error::SimError`], raised from inside the run.
